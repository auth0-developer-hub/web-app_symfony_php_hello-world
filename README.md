# Symfony/PHP: Starter Web App Code Sample

This PHP code sample demonstrates how to build web applications using Symfony and Twig.

Visit the ["Symfony/PHP Code Samples: App Security in Action"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/web-app/symfony) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources) to explore how you can secure Symfony applications written in PHP by implementing user authentication with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the Symfony Project

1. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

2. Run the project:

Execute the following command to run the Symfony project:

```bash
php -S localhost:4040 -t public
